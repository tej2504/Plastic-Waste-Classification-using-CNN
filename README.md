# Plastic-Waste-Classification-using-CNN
The project involves the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images of plastic waste into different categories. The aim is to build a robust and accurate model that can assist in identifying and categorizing plastic waste, thereby contributing to more efficient recycling and waste management practices.
